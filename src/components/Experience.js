Project Name: Smart Surveillance / Security
Distributed Systems Project:
This project aims to design and develop distributed systems by creating a set of protocols / messages and building a reference implementation that simulates the operations of a smart, automated environment.
• Created a cost-effective system to replace CCTV system. 
• Implemented technology in conjunction with a number of devices and sensors to continuously monitor closed regions 24/7, without need for a large-scale system or costly equipment (CCTV). 
Technology Used:
For Service Definitions and implementations - gRPC (protos).
For Naming Services - jmDNS.
Client - Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Project Name: iCARE
The project aims to develop a web application for telemedicine to conduct health services remotely by developing multiple applications that collect measurements and do management remotely.
• Created a Cardiac Application to track heart rate for patients with a high risk of developing arrhythmia.
• Developed an Insulin Pump Application to regulate glucose monitoring and insulin infusion in response to glucose levels.
• Designed a Ventilation Application with keen focus on assessing respiratory condition of mechanically ventilated patients by monitoring respiratory rate and oxygen saturation and directing requests to the ventilation machine.
Technology Used:
JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Angulary | Node.Js | Mongo Database | Google Maps API.Project Name: Smart Surveillance / Security Distributed Systems Project: This project aims to design and develop distributed systems by creating a set of protocols / messages and building a reference implementation that simulates the operations of a smart, automated environment. • Created a cost-effective system to replace CCTV system. • Implemented technology in conjunction with a number of devices and sensors to continuously monitor closed regions 24/7, without need for a large-scale system or costly equipment (CCTV).
